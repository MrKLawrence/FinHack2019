# Finhack 2019 - CreditMax


#MOTIVATION

CreditMax allows credit card users to receive right discount at the right time at the right location. It leverages indoor positioning system to identify userâ€™s location and pop out discount of merchant that nears user. It solved the problem of information overload regarding credit card discount and allows users to select the particular credit card that have discount with the merchants. 

We are planning to further reinforce our indoor positioning system and establish relationship with plazas to examine our solution.
